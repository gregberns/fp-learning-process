title: Algebraic Data Type
---

There are two types of Algebraic Data Types, also refered to as ADTs

* Sum types
* Product Types

---

Examples:

* Sum Type: `type Pair = Fst Int | Snd String`
* Product Type: `type Pair = P Int String`

These structures can be combined together to create more complex and nested data structures to represent most any data structures needed in computation.
