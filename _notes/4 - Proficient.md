title: 4 - Proficient
---

A level on the [[Ladder of Functional Programming]].

---

### CONCEPTS
* Codata
* (Co)Recursion Schemes
* Advanced Optics
* Dual Abstractions (Comonad)
* Monad Transformers
* Free Monads & Extensible Effects
* Functional Architecture
* Advanced Functors (Exponential, Profunctors, Contravariant)
* Embedded DSLs using GADTs, Finally Tagless
* Advanced Monads (Continuation, Logic)
* Type Families, Functional Dependencies

### SKILLS
* Design a minimally-powerful monad transformer stack
* Write concurrent and streaming programs
* Use purely functional mocking in tests
* Use type classes to modularly model different effects
* Recognize type patterns & abstract over them
* Use functional libraries in novel ways
* Use optics to manipulate state
* Write custom lawful monad transformers
* Use free monads / extensible effects to separate concerns
* Encode invariants at the type level
* Effectively use FDs / type families to create safer code
